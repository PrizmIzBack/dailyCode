## What is this?

This is a place where I **daily** upload **my code snippets**.

## My rules are :

1. Code **every day**;
2. Code **at least** 25 mins **daily**;
3. Focus on **how** to build my project not **what** to build;
4. Upload **daily**;

## Languages that I use :

* JavaScript;
* Shell Scripting;
* C++;

## Why I do this?

I'm a college student who learns how to code. Coding is a bit challenging for me; thus, I try to build a habit of coding by uploading daily.
